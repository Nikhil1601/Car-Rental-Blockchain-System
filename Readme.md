## General Information

- Use power of smart contracts to create decentralized car rental company. You can rent a car after depositing small amount of eth on contract address. After pick up a car timer will start count how long you use car before drop off. You can't rent another car before you drop off this one. You can't withdraw money before you drop off car. After drop off application will calculate due. From now you can pay due whenever you want but before it , you can't withdraw rest of your funds or even pick up another car.

## Project Status

Project is: in progress

<!-- / complete / no longer being worked on. If you are no longer working on it, provide reasons why. -->

## Room for Improvement

<!-- Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development. -->

Room for improvement:

- write more tests for contract
- add more information for user while exectuting contrract

To do:

- withdraw all available founds functionality
- visual improvement for good user experiance while waiting for contract execution
